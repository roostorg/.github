**We’re [ROOST](https://roost.tools) (Robust Open Online Safety Tools), a non-profit that builds, releases, and maintains modular, open-source infrastructure for online safety.** We serve product teams, trust & safety leads, and community moderators who need to review, triage, and enforce on harmful content without building everything from scratch or relying on opaque or expensive vendor tools. We focus on modular, self-hostable, and interoperable components.

Our founding [partners](https://roost.tools/partnerships) include Eric Schmidt, Discord, OpenAI, Google, Roblox, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, AI Collaborative, Patrick J. McGovern Foundation and Project Liberty Institute. ROOST also benefits from the support and expertise of a wide set of partners from the fields of AI, philanthropy, academia, open source, child safety, and countering violent extremism.
