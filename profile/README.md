[ROOST](https://roost.tools) (Robust Open Online Safety Tools) is a new non-profit organization that provides modular, open-source infrastructure for online safety. We serve product teams, trust & safety leads, and community moderators who need to review, triage, and enforce on harmful content without building everything from scratch or relying on opaque or expensive vendor tools. We build tools with a focus on modular, self-hostable, and interoperable components.

Our founding [partners](https://roost.tools/partnerships) include Eric Schmidt, Discord, OpenAI, Google, Roblox, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, AI Collaborative, Patrick J.
